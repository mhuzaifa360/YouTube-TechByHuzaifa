1. What is Web Development?
Web development means creating websites or web applications.

Every website you use (like YouTube, Google, or Facebook) is built by web developers.

Developers write code to make websites functional and interactive.

2. Types of Web Development
Web development is divided into three main parts:

a) Frontend Development
This is the part of the website you see and interact with (e.g., buttons, forms, designs).

Tools used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

b) Backend Development
This is the part you donâ€™t see. It includes servers, databases, and application logic.

Tools used: Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js.

c) Full Stack Development
Full stack developers work on both frontend and backend.

They can build complete websites.

3. Tools and Technologies
Here are some important tools used in web development:

Text Editors: VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom.

Browsers: Chrome, Firefox (for testing websites).

Frameworks: React (frontend), Django (backend), Bootstrap (styling).

Version Control: Git and GitHub (to manage code).

4. How to Learn Web Development?
Follow these steps to learn web development:

Learn Basics: Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
